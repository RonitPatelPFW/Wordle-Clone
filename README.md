# Wordle Clone

Welcome to the Wordle Clone! This is a simple word-guessing game inspired by the classic Wordle game. In this clone, you'll be challenged to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game features a difficulty setting, allowing you to choose between easy, medium, and hard levels with varying attempts.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:**
   - Your goal is to guess the hidden word.
   - The length of the word is displayed as a box, representing each letter's position.

2. **Difficulty Settings:**
   - Choose your preferred difficulty level:
     - **Easy:** 6 attempts.
     - **Medium:** 4 attempts.
     - **Hard:** 2 attempts.

3. **Making a Guess:**
   - Enter a guess in the input field and submit.
   - The game will provide feedback after each guess:
     - **Correct Letter and Position (Green Color):** The letter is in the right place.
     - **Correct Letter, Wrong Position (Yellow Color):** The letter is in the word but not in the right place.
     - **Incorrect Letter (Grey Color):** The letter is not in the word.

4. **Winning:**
   - If you guess the word within the allotted attempts, you win!

5. **Losing:**
   - If you exhaust all attempts without guessing the word, the game ends.
   - The hidden word will be revealed.

### Word Source

The hidden word in this Wordle Clone is dynamically fetched from the official New York Times Wordle site via a JSON file. Unlike using a static list, I dynamically retrieve the single Wordle word available for the day at the time of playing. This ensures a unique and fresh word for each playthrough.

The game fetches the word from the New York Times Wordle site to maintain freshness and unpredictability. This approach adds an extra layer of challenge and fun to the classic Wordle game, keeping players on their toes with each daily playthrough.
