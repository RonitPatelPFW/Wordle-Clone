# Wordle Clone

Welcome to the Wordle Clone! This is a simple word-guessing game inspired by the classic Wordle game. In this clone, you'll be challenged to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game features a difficulty setting, allowing you to choose between easy, medium, and hard levels with varying attempts.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:**
   - Your goal is to guess the hidden word.
   - The length of the word is displayed as a box, representing each letter's position.

2. **Difficulty Settings:**
   - Choose your preferred difficulty level:
     - **Easy:** 6 attempts.
     - **Medium:** 4 attempts.
     - **Hard:** 2 attempts.

3. **Making a Guess:**
   - Enter a guess in the input field and submit.
   - The game will provide feedback after each guess:
     - **Correct Letter and Position:** The letter is in the right place.
     - **Correct Letter, Wrong Position:** The letter is in the word but not in the right place.
     - **Incorrect Letter:** The letter is not in the word.

4. **Winning:**
   - If you guess the word within the allotted attempts, you win!

5. **Losing:**
